~ title: Course description and policies

CS 195 is a discussion-intensive course about the social implications of
computing. The purpose of this course is to help computer science students make
informed and thoughtful choices about their careers, participation in society,
and future development activities. Readings and lecture topics are drawn from a
range of fields that together seek to describe our contemporary global society:
sociology, philosophy, economics, public policy, etc.

Weekly Schedule
---------------

The week before each Wednesday class meeting will be used to prepare for the
upcoming discussion-oriented class section.

* On Tuesday, interested students may drop by Josh's office (779 Soda) at time (TBA) 
  for ideally what will be a lively discussion about the week's topic.

* On Wednesday, class will consist of lecture and discussion on the weekly topic.
  All students should complete the readings and weekly survey before class.

Surveys
-------

Lecture topics will not be determined only by the wisdom of your instructor.
Instead, you will collectively choose your own adventure through the material.
A brief survey about each upcoming topic will be emailed to the class each
week. Before class begins, please complete the survey, in which you can vote on
the issues or questions most interesting to you. The results of these surveys
will guide our discussions.

Essays
------

In addition, you will write three short essays (500-1000 words) that contain
your original thoughts about issues from the class. All students will write
about the same topics, and your work will be reviewed by your peers. Essay
assignments will appear in the reading list and be announced in class.

Grading
-------

The course is graded P/NP. The reason for that policy is to ensure that you can
feel free to express opinions different from those of the instructors, both in
class meetings and in written work.
