~ title: Course description and policies

CS 195 is a discussion-intensive course about the social implications of
computer technology. The purpose of this course is to help students make
informed and thoughtful choices about their careers, participation in society,
and future development activities. Readings and lecture topics are drawn from a
range of fields that together seek to describe our contemporary global society:
sociology, philosophy, economics, public policy, etc.

Readings for each week will be released on the Tuesday before class.
**Finish the readings before class!**

Small-group discussion sections will cover topics to be discussed in the following lecture.
You are only required to attend one discussion section (total, not per week).

Lecture topics will not be determined only by the wisdom of your instructor.
Instead, you will collectively choose your own adventure through the material.  To guide discussion topics, a weekly survey will be announced on Piazza.
**Finish the weekly survey by Monday 2 PM!**

Essays
------

You will write three short essays (500-1000 words) that contain
your original thoughts about issues from the class.  You can choose from the
prompts we provide or choose your own essay topic subject to approval by the
course instructors.  Essays will be announced on the website, in class, and
on Piazza.

Essays are peer reviewed, which means you will review nine essays and have each
of your essays reviewed by three of your peers.  You will also have the option
of posting your essays publicly. Those who do so will be eligible for prizes.

Peer Conversations
-------

We would like to encourage you to explore a range of perspectives on the issues
we will be discussing in this course.  This semester, we will put you in 
contact with one of your peers and suggest a prompt for you to discuss in 
one-on-one conversation with an assigned peer for at least half an
hour, at a time and place of your choice.  If you decide to go through with the conversation, you will be entered in a drawing for a prize. 

Grading
-------

The course is graded P/NP. The reason for that policy is to ensure that you can
feel free to express opinions different from those of the instructors, both in
class meetings and in written work.

In order to receive a passing grade in CS 195, you must complete the objectives
listed below:

 * Attend at least 10 out of 12 lectures.
 * Complete at least 9 out of 11 pre-lecture surveys.
 * Submit 3 essays and receive a passing peer review grade on all of them.
 * Provide peer reviews for 9 essays.
 * Attend 1 small-group discussion.

In the event that you do not earn the required number of points, we will provide
an opportunity to make up extra work, though you should not count on this.

Lecture and Attendance
---------------

Lecture is going to be a mix of discussion, video clips, students asking questions,
small group discussion, and class-wide debriefing.  Attendance will be taken in
class as well as in small-group discussion.
