~ title: Course description and policies

CS 195 is a discussion-intensive course about the social implications of
computing. The purpose of this course is to help computer science students make
informed and thoughtful choices about their careers, participation in society,
and future development activities. Readings and lecture topics are drawn from a
range of fields that together seek to describe our contemporary global society:
sociology, philosophy, economics, public policy, etc.

Weekly Schedule
---------------

The week before each Friday class meeting will be used to prepare for the
upcoming discussion-oriented class section.

* Over the weekend, any student who is attending discussion sections and
  writing commentary for the upcoming topic should complete the readings.

* Small-group discussions will be held Monday through Wednesday to develop
  commentary topics and assign students to commentaries.

* Commentaries will be completed and shared with the class by Thursday at noon.

* On Friday, class will consist of lecture and discussion on the weekly topic.
  All students should complete the readings and weekly survey before class.

Discussions
-----------

Each student will select *one* weekly topic that interests them the most and
contribute commentary on a reading for that topic. You are required to attend a
small-group discussion section during the week before the topic is discussed in
lecture, in order to clarify your commentary ideas. A schedule of discussions
will be published each week.

A survey will be released on Wednesday 2/4 in which you will select a topic.

Commentaries
------------

For the topic of interest you select, you will collaboratively author a
commentary document about the topic & chosen reading. A commentary is a short
(~300 word) analysis or opinion statement related to a reading. Each commentary
should begin with a thesis or topic sentence that clearly states which reading
is being addressed. For example, a commentary related to the privacy reading
"Addicted to Apps" could critique the article's statement that, "Inside tech
companies, engineers would rather set aside pesky impediments like government
regulations, social mores and people's fear of change."

Topics of commentaries will be chosen during small-group discussion, which you
need to attend during the week that you choose to write a commentary. Each
commentary will be edited collaboratively as a Google Doc by a subset of the
students who have selected to attend discussion that week. In order to
contribute to a commentary (and thereby fulfill your course requirement), you
must improve the Google Doc in some way and add your name to the bottom.

The text of each commentary (without author names) will be posted to Piazza on
Thursday at noon before class, so that other students can read it and discuss
it. Some commentaries may be selected for a short in-class presentation. The
instructor will contact authors via email about these optional presentations.

Surveys
-------

Lecture topics will not be determined only by the wisdom of your instructor.
Instead, you will collectively choose your own adventure through the material.
A brief survey about each upcoming topic will be emailed to the class each
week. Before class begins, please complete the survey, in which you can vote on
the issues or questions most interesting to you. The results of these surveys
will guide our discussions.

Essays
------

In addition, you will write three short essays (500-1000 words) that contain
your original thoughts about issues from the class. All students will write
about the same topics, and your work will be reviewed by your peers. Essay
assignments will appear in the reading list and be announced in class.

Grading
-------

The course is graded P/NP. The reason for that policy is to ensure that you can
feel free to express opinions different from those of the instructors, both in
class meetings and in written work.

In order to receive a passing grade in CS 195, you must:

 * Complete at least 10 surveys
 * Participate in 1 collaborative commentary and attend its small-group discussion section
 * Submit 3 essays and receive a passing peer review (3/5) on all of them
 * Provide peer reviews for 9 essays

Students who attend at least 10 class sessions and respond to discussion
questions during class may skip/drop one of the essays and 3 peer reviews.
