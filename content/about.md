~ title: Course description and policies

CS 195 is a discussion-intensive course about the social implications of
computing. The purpose of this course is to help you and your fellow computer
science students make informed and thoughtful choices about your careers,
your participation in society, and your future development activities.
Readings and lecture topics  are drawn from a range of fields that together
seek to describe our contemporary global society: sociology, philosophy,
economics, public policy, education, and journalism.

**Meetings.** The weekly class meetings (Wednesdays, 4-5:30pm in 1 LeConte)
will include short presentations by the instructors, small group discussions
among students, and full-class moderated discussions.

Discussion questions will not be determined only by the wisdom of your
instructors. Instead, you will collectively choose your own adventure through
the material. By 4:00pm on Tuesday before each class, you will complete a brief
survey in which you can vote on the issues or questions most interesting to
you. The results of these surveys will guide our discussions.

**Summaries.** The topics discussed in this class are all broad and deep, and
so the course includes a mountain of reading. You are not expected to
read it all, but you should definitely read about the topics that interest
you the most. For the rest, your classmates will write and share short
summaries of the readings, so that everyone can follow the main ideas of the
discussions. In exchange for your right to vote on discussion topics, you are
expected to prepare for every class by reading the assigned articles or their
summaries.

At the beginning of the semester, you will sign up for topics that interest
you the most. You will be expected to write two summaries for at least one
article in each of these topics. The first summary should take 3 minutes to
read. The second should take 30 seconds. Summaries must be shared with
other summarizers on Piazza by 5pm on Friday before class.

Each Friday 5pm-6pm, any student who has written a summary may attend
the small group discussion with the instructor(s) on the upcoming topic.
Expect a lively debate.

**Essays.** In addition, you will write three short essays that contain your
original analysis of issues from the class. All students will write about the
same topics, and your work will be reviewed by your peers. Details of
this evaluation will be posted shortly.

**Grading.** The course is graded P/NP. The reason for that policy is to
ensure that you can feel free to express opinions different from those of the
instructors, both in class meetings and in written work.

In order to receive a passing grade in CS 195, you must:

 * Attend at least 11 of the 13 class sessions.
 * Summarize at least 3 articles, for which you signed up.
 * Submit the 3 short essays and receive a passing consensus review on each.
 * Provide peer reviews for 9 essays.
