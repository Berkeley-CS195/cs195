## Readings

There is a course reader at Copy Central, 48 Shattuck Square (that little
island in the middle of Shattuck south of University). All assigned readings
are either in the course reader or online.

In order to save you money, and improve readability, many of the readings are
available online. For most of these readings you need to have your
[UC Berkeley library proxy server enabled][proxy] on your web browser, or
install the [Berkeley VPN][vpn] on your computer (better privacy).
